# Binary-Search-Tree

A special type of binary tree where each node has at most two children, the values in left sub-tree of a node are less than or equal to the node's value, while the right sub-tree values are greater than node value

### Level order traversal

Each level of Binary search tree from root towards leaf will be traversed one by one. Every node on a level from right to left will be traversed and than, the next level will be traversed in the same way
